      everytime a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function; the 'this' variable is created for that function; the variables in it are set-up during the creation phase; every line of code is executed line-by-line
      <br>
      everytime a new function is invoked, a new execution context is created, put on top of the execution stack; when the funcion finishes, it is popped off; whatever's at the top is what's currently running, line-by-line, synchronously
    example 1:
    <br />
    function b() { }
    <!-- another Execution Context (create and execute)  -->

    function a(){ b() }
    <!-- new Execution Context ic created and placed on the execution stack(create and execute line by line)  -->

    a()
    <!-- Global Execution Context(created and code is executed)  -->

    example 2:
    <br />
    function a(){ 
        b() <!--2nd-->
        var c <!--4th-->
    } 
    function b(){ 
        var d <!--3rd-->
    } 
    a() <!--1st-->
    var d <!--5th-->
