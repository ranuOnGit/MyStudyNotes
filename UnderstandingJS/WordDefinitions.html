    <h3>Syntax Parser</h3>
    <p>
      A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its
      grammar is valid
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Lexical Environment</h3>
    <p>Where something sits physically in the code you write</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Execution Context</h3>
    <p>A wrapper to help manage the code that is running</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Name/Value Pair</h3>
    <p>A name which maps to a unique value</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Object</h3>
    <p>
      A collection of Name Value pairs; values can be another collection of
      name-vaue pairs
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Single Threaded</h3>
    <p>One command (executed) at a time</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Synchronous</h3>
    <p>One (line of code being executed) at a time (and in order it appears)</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Invocation</h3>
    <p>
      Running a function
      <br />
      In javascript, by using paranthesis ()
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Variable Environment</h3>
    <p>
      Where the variables live (and how they relate to each other in memory)
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>
      Where a variable is available in your code
      <br />
      let - block scope
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Asynchronous</h3>
    <p>More than one at a time</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Dynamic Typing</h3>
    <p>
      You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures
      it out while your code is running
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Primitive Type</h3>
    <p>
      A type of data that represents a single value; not an object (collection
      of name-value pairs)
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Operator</h3>
    <p>
      A special function that is syntactically (written) differently
      <br />
      Operators take two parameters and return one result
      <br />
      + , - , > , < etc.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      + 3 4 : pre-fix notation <br />
      3 4 + : post-fix notation <br />
      3 + 4 : in-fix notation
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Operator Precedence</h3>
    <p>Which operator function gets called first (higher gets called first)</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Associativity</h3>
    <p>
      What order operator functions get called in: left-to-right OR
      right-to-left (when fnctions have same precendence)
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Coercion</h3>
    <p>Converting a value from one type to another</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Namespace</h3>
    <p>
      A container for variables and functions
      <br />
      Typically to keep variables amd functions with the same name separate
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>First Class Functions</h3>
    <p>Everything you can do with other types, you can do with functions
      <br>
      Assign them to variables, pass them around, create them on fly
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Expression</h3>
    <p>A unit of code that results in a value (value does not have to be saved inside a variable)</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Statement</h3>
    <p>Does not return a value (like an If statement)</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Mutate</h3>
    <p>To change something</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Immutable</h3>
    <p>Cannot be changed</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Array</h3>
    <p>Collections of anything</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <p>the parameters passed to a function</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Whitespace</h3>
    <p>Invisible characters that create literal 'space' in written code (ccarriage returns, tabs, spaces)</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Callback Function</h3>
    <p>A function you give to another function, to be run when the other function is finished</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Function Currying</h3>
    <p>Creating a copy of a function but with some preset parameters (useful in mathematical situations)</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>An object can look at itself, listing and changing is propoerties and methods</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Function Constructors</h3>
    <p>A normal function that is used to construct objects
      <br>
      The 'this' variable points a new empty object, and that object is returned from the function automatically
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Polyfill</h3>
    <p>Code that adds a feature which the engine may lack</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Syntactic Sugar</h3>
    <p>A different way to type something that doesn't change how it works under the hood</p>
